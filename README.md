#### How's FeedPulse looking? Well I'm glad you asked

![Personal FeedPulse overview](./static/images/feedpulse-ratings-personal-18-04-2024.png)
![Group FeedPulse overview](./static/images/feedpulse-ratings-group-18-04-2024.png)

#### What's changed since last time?

- Morris has helped significantly more in the duo case in regard to documentation, coding and designing.
- I've consistently been receiving weekly feedback from Erik.
- Commit messaging are actually meaningful nowadays.
  ![Git commit history](./static/images/git-commit-history-18-04-2024.png)
- Ended up not involving JIRA more, as we saw it was not necessary due to our communication in it's current state already being sufficient for the complexity of the project.
- Design thinking was implemented much more and very useful as a structure to hold onto.

### Week 1 - 3

- Created this portfolio.
- Got a basic information infrastructure working, the duo project has a corresponding [Github organization](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/) and a [JIRA board](/static/images/Jira-screenshot-21-02-2024.png).
- Created the research document in regard to the [duo app 'Cultural Exchange'](https://github.com/S4-Smart-mobile/S4-Smart-Mobile/blob/main/documentation/research/cultural-exchange.md).

  - Created the [design](https://www.figma.com/file/lehYegLvaF8PYE0Y9X5rNB/Cultural-Exchange?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=UvwBHFVfqxP3820K-1) for the duo case.
  - Created the [poster](https://www.figma.com/file/wQYRmiwEKuVhwoQeEhjFzZ/Cultural-exchange---Posters?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=3BUz67FEdluEC0gd-1) for the duo case.

- Did some mini-research for the individual project's [tech case 24 'Microphone Mixer'](/documentation/microphone-mixer-technical-design.md). _(The document displays the technical side of the case.)_

#### How's FeedPulse looking? Well I'm glad you asked

![FeedPulse ratings](./static/images/feedpulse-ratings-05-03-2024.png)

#### What's changing for next time?

- Get actual FeedPulse checkpoints with Erik. _(I asked, received and documented feedback but not inside of FeedPulse.)_
- Useful commit messaging, even in the personal projects. No more of

![An image displaying bad commit messages](./static/images/bad-commit-messages.png)

- Asking Morris to help more in the duo case's design and/or documentation.
- Actually using the JIRA created for the duo case.
- Implement the 'design thinking' framework better into the entire process.

Though these improvements seem like a big bunch, it's mostly minor QoL (quality of life) changes. **I still think I had a good start and hope to keep this spirit during the semester.**
