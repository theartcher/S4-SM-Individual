# What the f\*\*\* is this?

This is very basic node code for creating an unsecured web-socket for RTC (real-time communication). All messages received are echo'd back to all clients except the original sender.

## Getting started

1. Copy/clone repository.
2. Open a terminal.
3. Open folder which code was copied/cloned to.
4. Run the command.

   ```bash
   npm i
   ```

5. Wait for installation to finish.
6. Run the command.

   ```bash
   node .
   ```

7. An (-unsecured) web-socket is now running on [localhost:8000](localhost:8000).
